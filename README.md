# 3D Simulation of Vehicle-Bridge-Interaction
 
This repository is used to simulate the 3D vehicle-bridge-interaction introduced in our published paper: Jian, X., Xia, Y., & Sun, L. (2022). Indirect identification of bridge frequencies using a four-wheel vehicle: Theory and three-dimensional simulation. Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, 177, 109155.

Run Simulation_VBI.m to carry out the simulation.

If you use this code in your academic work or any work with publicly available reports, please cite our paper.
